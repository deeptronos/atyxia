# atyxia
A repository for *Dreams of Digital Demise Act I: Atyxia*, a personal video game project involving magical realism, blistering close-quarters combat, and  
satire of overconsumption.\
It is built in Gamemaker Studio 2.3. You will need a copy of the engine to load/compile the "pre-alpha" form of the game. \
I began this project during the final month of my senior year of high school as my "Senior Project", and someday I'll return to it.
